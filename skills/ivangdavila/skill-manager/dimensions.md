# Skill Discovery Dimensions

Reference only — not in context. Consult when deciding whether to search for skills.

## Proactive Search Triggers

**High-value signals (search immediately):**
- User asks for same type of task 3+ times
- Task involves specific tool/API you're unsure about
- User says "I always have to..." or "every time I..."
- Complex domain (legal, medical, finance, specific tech)
- User struggling with something that feels solvable

**Medium signals (consider searching):**
- New project type you haven't done with this user
- User mentions tool/service by name
- Task requires specialized knowledge
- User asks "is there a better way?"

**Low signals (probably don't search):**
- One-off simple request
- User already knows exactly what they want
- General conversation

## Skill Categories to Know
- **Tech stacks:** flutter, nextjs, react, python, rust, go
- **Tools:** github, gitlab, figma, notion, stripe, aws
- **Domains:** legal, medical, finance, marketing, sales
- **Formats:** pdf, excel, email, presentations
- **Platforms:** ios, android, web, desktop
- **Workflows:** devops, ci-cd, testing, deployment

## User Appetite Signals
- "Install whatever helps" → proactive mode
- "Ask me first" → propose, don't install
- "I prefer minimal" → only high-impact skills
- Ignores suggestions → reduce frequency
- Installs everything → keep suggesting

## Installation Tracking
For each skill, track:
- When installed
- Version
- Why (what triggered it)
- If removed: why removed
- If declined: reason given

## Re-proposal Rules
- Rejected skill: don't propose again unless user context changed significantly
- Removed skill: can mention if relevant, but note it was removed before
- Failed skill: note what didn't work, only repropose if fixed
